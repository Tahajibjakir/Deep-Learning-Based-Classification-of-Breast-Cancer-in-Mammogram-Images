# Deep Learning-Based Classification of Breast Cancer in Mammogram Images
• Proposed a novel hybrid deep learning architecture (BreastNet) by integrating DenseNet201 and Xception for mammogram-based breast cancer classification, achieving 99.50% accuracy and near-perfect precision, recall, and F1-score, outperforming multiple state-of-the-art CNN models.
• Designed an end-to-end medical image analysis pipeline involving advanced preprocessing (CLAHE, contrast stretching, bilateral filtering, and augmentation) and cross-dataset validation, demonstrating strong generalization on the INbreast dataset (95.55% mean accuracy) and clinical reliability for early breast cancer diagnosis.
